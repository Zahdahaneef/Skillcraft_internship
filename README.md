# 🏠House Price Prediction Using Regression Model(Linear):
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project developed during the SkillCraft Machine Learning Internship. This project uses a Linear Regression model to estimate the sale prices of houses based on a rich set of features.
# 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict house prices using the Ames Housing dataset, which includes:

 * 🏡 1,460 training records
* 📋 81 features in train, 80 in test
* 🎯 Target variable: SalePrice

# performed:

* Data cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Outlier and skewness handling
* Feature selection
* Linear Regression modeling

# 🧪 Tools & Libraries
* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* scikit-learn

# 🔍 Results
✅ Strong correlation between features like OverallQual, GrLivArea, and SalePrice
✅ R² value indicates good model fit
✅ Model generalizes well after data transformation and cleaning
